## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Repository Restructuring

One of the major changes in this release was restructuring the repository to align with our deployment strategy:

```bash
# New structure moves application code into src/
tiger-grades/
├── src/           # Main application code
├── migrations/    # Database migrations
├── scripts/       # Deployment and utility scripts
└── docs/         # Documentation site
```

This restructuring improves deployment reliability and makes the codebase more maintainable.

### Database Variable Processing

The new variable processing system allows for flexible database configurations:

```php
// Example of @variable processing in migrations
$variables = [
    '@wp_prefix' => $GLOBALS['wpdb']->prefix,
    '@charset' => 'utf8mb4',
    '@collate' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'
];
```

### Grade Processing Logic

Enhanced grade handling now supports multiple grade states:

- **Exempt (E)**: Excluded from grade calculations
- **Empty**: Assignments not yet graded
- **Completed**: Assignments with recorded scores
- **Zero (0)**: Explicit zero scores vs. missing work

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Shell Scripting
- Fixed shell if syntax in deployment scripts
- Improved error handling in automated workflows

### Database Cleanup
- Removed `db_version` option in deactivation hook
- Eliminated unnecessary `uninstall.php` file
- Incremented JavaScript file versions for proper cache invalidation

### Grade Type Handling
- Adapted API and shortcode for case sensitivity in grade types
- Updated seed and teardown scripts for STEM grades in science classes
- Improved grade type consistency across the system

## 📊 Development Environment

### Release Environment Support

Added support for multiple deployment environments:

```yaml
# Example deployment configuration
environment: release
deploy_path: /var/www/production
installation_path: /wordpress
```

This enables smooth transitions between development, staging, and production environments.
