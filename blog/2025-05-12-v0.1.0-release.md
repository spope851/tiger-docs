## 🌟 Major Highlights

### ☁️ **Revolutionary Azure Functions Integration**

The crown jewel of this release is our **seamless Microsoft Azure integration**. Tiger Grades now leverages Azure Functions for serverless gradebook creation, delivering enterprise-scale reliability with zero infrastructure management.

```php
// Automated gradebook creation via Azure orchestration
$microservice_response = $this->call_class_registration_microservice(
    $teachers_folder_name, 
    $gradebook_name, 
    $email, 
    $class_id
);
```

**What this means for educators:**
- 🚀 **Instant Gradebook Creation**: Excel gradebooks appear in OneDrive within minutes
