# üöÄ Tiger Grades v0.0.4 Released: Enhanced Analytics & Version Management

We're excited to announce the release of **Tiger Grades v0.0.4**, featuring enhanced category weight analytics, improved version management, and expanded multilingual support with Mandarin translations.

## ‚ú® What's New in v0.0.4

### üìä Category Weight Analytics

The standout feature of this release is the new **category weight visualization system**. Teachers can now view detailed analytics about how grade categories impact overall student performance:

```javascript
// New AJAX endpoint for category weight analysis
fetch('/wp-json/tiger-grades/v1/analytics/category-weights', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ 
        class_id: classId, 
        grade_type: 'current_semester' 
    })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => displayCategoryWeights(data));
```

This feature provides:
- **Real-time weight calculations** for each grade category
- **Visual breakdown** of how categories contribute to final grades
- **Interactive charts** showing category impact across different grade types
- **Actionable insights** for optimizing grading strategies

### üîß Professional Version Management

We've introduced the **VersionManager class** to streamline version tracking and deployment processes:

```php
class VersionManager {
    public function getCurrentVersion() {
        // Reads version from main plugin file header
        return $this->parsePluginHeader('Version');
    }
    
    public function incrementVersion($type = 'patch') {
        // Automated version incrementation
        // Supports: major, minor, patch
    }
}
```

**Key Benefits**:
- **Automated version tracking** based on plugin file headers
- **DevOps-ready** for CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Consistent versioning** across development and production
- **Future-proof** architecture for automated releases

### üåç Mandarin Translation Support

Expanding our commitment to multilingual education, v0.0.4 includes:

- **Complete Mandarin translations** for the version shortcode
- **Improved translation infrastructure** for future language additions
- **Cultural localization** considerations for Chinese-speaking educators
- **Unicode support** for proper character rendering

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

This release includes significant caching improvements:

- **Enhanced cache clearing** in deployment workflows
- **Optimized asset loading** for faster page renders
- **Reduced database queries** through intelligent caching
- **CDN-ready** asset management

## üîß Technical Improvements

### New API Endpoints

```php
// Category weight analytics endpoint
add_action('wp_ajax_tiger_grades_category_weights', function() {
    $class_id = intval($_POST['class_id']);
    $grade_type = sanitize_text_field($_POST['grade_type']);
    
    $weights = TigerGrades\Analytics\CategoryAnalyzer::getWeights(
        $class_id, 
        $grade_type
    );
    
    wp_send_json_success($weights);
});
```

### Enhanced Deployment Pipeline

Our deployment workflow now includes:
- **Automated cache clearing** via LiteSpeed integration
- **Version validation** before deployment
- **Database migration checks** with rollback capability
- **Performance monitoring** post-deployment

### Version Shortcode Enhancement

```php
// New version display shortcode with i18n support
add_shortcode('tiger_grades_version', function($atts) {
    $version = VersionManager::getCurrentVersion();
    $build = VersionManager::getBuildNumber();
    
    return sprintf(
        '<span class="tiger-grades-version" data-version="%s" data-build="%s">%s</span>',
        esc_attr($version),
        esc_attr($build),
        esc_html(
            sprintf(
                __('Tiger Grades v%s (Build %s)', 'tiger-grades'),
                $version,
                $build
            )
        )
    );
