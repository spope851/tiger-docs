## üîê Enrollment Management

### Secure Enrollment Codes

Each class receives a unique 6-character enrollment code that:

- **Limits access** to intended students only
- **Tracks enrollment attempts** for security auditing
- **Prevents unauthorized access** through randomized generation

### Enrollment Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    participant O as OneDrive

    T->>TG: Create class
    TG->>O: Generate gradebook
    TG->>T: Provide enrollment code
    T->>S: Share code (secure method)
    S->>TG: Enter code + student info
    TG->>T: Notification for approval
    T->>TG: Approve enrollment
    TG->>O: Add student to gradebook
    TG->>S: Confirmation + access granted
```
