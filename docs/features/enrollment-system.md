# Enrollment System üë•

Tiger Grades features a sophisticated enrollment system that streamlines student registration while maintaining security and administrative control. Our intelligent workflow ensures accurate class rosters, secure access management, and seamless integration with existing school systems.

## üéØ Overview

The Tiger Grades Enrollment System provides:

- **Secure Enrollment Codes** with time-based expiration
- **Multi-Step Approval Workflow** for teacher control
- **Automated Verification** and duplicate detection
- **Bulk Enrollment Management** for administrative efficiency
- **Integration Ready** for SIS and LMS systems
- **Real-Time Status Tracking** for all stakeholders

## üîê Enrollment Security Model

### Secure Code Generation

Each class receives a unique enrollment code designed for maximum security:

```php
class EnrollmentCodeGenerator {
    private const CODE_LENGTH = 6;
    private const VALID_CHARACTERS = 'ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'; // Excludes confusing characters
    
    public function generateCode($class_id) {
        do {
            $code = '';
            for ($i = 0; $i < self::CODE_LENGTH; $i++) {
                $code .= self::VALID_CHARACTERS[random_int(0, strlen(self::VALID_CHARACTERS) - 1)];
            }
        } while ($this->codeExists($code)); // Ensure uniqueness
        
        return $code;
    }
}
```

### Code Security Features

**Anti-Collision Protection:**
- Cryptographically secure random generation
- Duplicate detection across all active codes
- Automatic regeneration when conflicts occur
- Character set optimization to prevent confusion

**Expiration Management:**
```sql
-- Enrollment codes with automatic expiration
CREATE TABLE wp_tigr_enrollment_codes (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    class_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    code VARCHAR(6) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    max_uses INT DEFAULT NULL,
    current_uses INT DEFAULT 0
);
```

## üìù Enrollment Workflow

### Student Registration Process

The enrollment journey follows a carefully designed multi-step process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Student/Parent
    participant TG as Tiger Grades
    participant T as Teacher
    participant O as OneDrive
    participant E as Email System

    S->>TG: Enter enrollment code
    TG->>TG: Validate code & check expiration
    TG->>S: Request student information
    S->>TG: Submit enrollment form
    TG->>TG: Validate & check duplicates
    TG->>T: Send approval notification
    T->>TG: Review & approve enrollment
    TG->>O: Add student to gradebook
    TG->>S: Send confirmation email
    TG->>E: Notify parent portal access
```

### Enrollment Form Fields

**Required Information:**
- Student full name (first, middle, last)
- Parent/guardian contact information
- Emergency contact details
- Special accommodations or notes

**Optional Fields:**
- Preferred name/nickname
- Previous school information
- Relevant medical information

**Validation Rules:**
```javascript
const enrollmentValidation = {
    student_name: {
        required: true,
        minLength: 2,
        maxLength: 45,
        pattern: /^[a-zA-Z\s\-'\.]+$/
    },
    parent_email: {
        required: true,

    },
    special_notes: {
        maxLength: 500,
        sanitize: true
    }
};
```

## ‚úÖ Approval & Management

### Teacher Review Dashboard

Teachers access a comprehensive dashboard for managing enrollment requests:

**Pending Enrollments:**
- Student information summary
- Parent contact details
- Enrollment timestamp
- Special notes or accommodations
- Quick approve/deny actions

**Approval Interface:**
```php
class EnrollmentApproval {
    public function displayPendingEnrollments($teacher_id) {
        $enrollments = $this->getPendingEnrollments($teacher_id);
        
        foreach ($enrollments as $enrollment) {
            echo $this->renderEnrollmentCard([
                'student_name' => $enrollment->student_name,
                'parent_info' => $enrollment->parent_contact,
                'submitted_date' => $enrollment->created,
                'actions' => [
                    'approve' => $this->getApprovalUrl($enrollment->id),
                    'deny' => $this->getDenialUrl($enrollment->id),
                    'request_info' => $this->getInfoRequestUrl($enrollment->id)
                ]
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

### Batch Processing

**Bulk Operations:**
- Approve multiple enrollments simultaneously
- Export enrollment data for external systems
- Generate parent communication templates
- Create class roster snapshots

```php
// Bulk approval example
$bulkProcessor = new BulkEnrollmentProcessor();
$results = $bulkProcessor->processApprovals($enrollment_ids, [
    'auto_notify_parents' => true,
    'add_to_gradebook' => true,
    'send_welcome_email' => true,
    'create_portal_access' => true
]);
```

## üìä Enrollment Analytics

### Real-Time Monitoring

**Enrollment Metrics:**
- Current enrollment vs. class capacity
- Enrollment rate trends over time
- Geographic distribution of students
- Peak enrollment periods

**Dashboard Widgets:**
```typescript
interface EnrollmentMetrics {
    current_enrollment: number;
    capacity: number;
    pending_requests: number;
    enrollment_rate: {
        daily: number;
        weekly: number;
        monthly: number;
    };
    demographics: {
        grade_levels: Record<string, number>;
        previous_schools: Record<string, number>;
        special_needs: number;
    };
}
```

### Predictive Analytics

**Enrollment Forecasting:**
- Predict final enrollment based on historical patterns
- Identify optimal enrollment periods
- Suggest capacity adjustments
- Alert for unusual enrollment activity

```python
def predict_enrollment(historical_data, current_trends):
    # Machine learning model for enrollment prediction
    model = EnrollmentPredictor()
    model.train(historical_data)
    
    prediction = model.predict(current_trends)
    
    return {
        'predicted_final_enrollment': prediction.final_count,
        'confidence_interval': prediction.confidence,
        'recommended_actions': prediction.suggestions
    }
```

## üîÑ Integration Capabilities

### Student Information System (SIS)

**Bidirectional Sync:**
- Import student data from existing SIS
- Export enrollment updates back to SIS

        $name_matches = $this->findSimilarNames(
            $enrollment_data['student_name'],
            0.8 // 80% similarity threshold
        );
        
        // Check email matches
        $email_matches = $this->findEmailMatches(
            $enrollment_data['parent_email']
        );
        
        // Check phone matches
        $phone_matches = $this->findPhoneMatches(
            $enrollment_data['emergency_contact']
        );
        
        return array_merge($name_matches, $email_matches, $phone_matches);
    }
}
```
