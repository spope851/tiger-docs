# Grading System üìä

Tiger Grades features a sophisticated, flexible grading system designed to meet the diverse needs of modern educational institutions. Built with both simplicity and power in mind, our grading engine supports multiple assessment methods while maintaining transparency for all stakeholders.

## üéØ Overview

The Tiger Grades grading system provides:

- **Real-time Grade Calculations** with automatic updates
- **Flexible Category Weighting** for different assignment types  
- **Standards-Based Assessment** options
- **Multi-Semester Support** for year-long courses
- **Progress Tracking** with visual analytics
- **Automated Report Generation** for parents and students

## üìã Grade Categories & Weighting

### Category Configuration

Teachers can organize assignments into customizable categories:

```php
// Example category structure
$categories = [
    'homework' => ['weight' => 25, 'color' => '#4CAF50'],
    'quizzes' => ['weight' => 25, 'color' => '#FF9800'], 
    'exams' => ['weight' => 40, 'color' => '#F44336'],
    'participation' => ['weight' => 10, 'color' => '#2196F3']
];
```

### Dynamic Weight Adjustment

The system automatically handles:
- **Proportional Recalculation** when categories are added/removed
- **Zero-Weight Handling** for unused categories
- **Custom Scaling** for different grading scales (100-point, 4.0 GPA, etc.)

## üî¢ Grade Calculation Engine

### Core Algorithm

Tiger Grades uses a weighted average system with intelligent handling of edge cases:

```typescript
function calculateWeightedAverage(assignments: Assignment[], categories: Category[]): number {
    let totalPoints = 0;
    let totalWeight = 0;
    
    categories.forEach(category => {
        const categoryAssignments = assignments.filter(a => a.category === category.id);
        if (categoryAssignments.length > 0) {
            const categoryAverage = categoryAssignments.reduce((sum, a) => sum + a.score, 0) / categoryAssignments.length;
            totalPoints += categoryAverage * category.weight;
            totalWeight += category.weight;
        }
    });
    
    return totalWeight > 0 ? totalPoints / totalWeight : 0;
}
```

### Special Grade Handling

The system intelligently processes:
- **Exempt Grades** (marked as 'E') - excluded from calculations
- **Missing Assignments** (marked as 'M') - handled per teacher preference  
- **Extra Credit** - can exceed category maximum
- **Late Penalties** - automatic or manual deductions

## üìà Standards-Based Grading

### Proficiency Levels

Tiger Grades supports standards-based assessment with customizable proficiency scales:

| Level | Description | Numeric Value |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Exceeding** | Demonstrates mastery beyond grade level | 4.0 |
| **Meeting** | Demonstrates grade-level mastery | 3.0 |
| **Approaching** | Progressing toward mastery | 2.0 |
| **Beginning** | Beginning to develop understanding | 1.0 |

### Standards Tracking

Each assignment can be linked to learning standards for comprehensive progress monitoring:

```json
{
  "assignment": "Fraction Operations Quiz",
  "standards": [
    "5.NF.A.1", // Add and subtract fractions
    "5.NF.A.2", // Solve word problems with fractions
  ],
  "proficiency_scores": {
    "5.NF.A.1": 3.5,
    "5.NF.A.2": 2.8
  }
}
```

## üìä Grade Analytics & Insights

### Visual Progress Tracking

Tiger Grades generates comprehensive analytics including:

- **Trend Analysis** - Grade progression over time

## üîÑ Real-Time Synchronization

### Excel Integration

Tiger Grades maintains two-way synchronization with Excel gradebooks stored in OneDrive:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Teacher enters grade in Excel] --> B[OneDrive sync]
    B --> C[Graph API webhook]
    C --> D[Tiger Grades database update]
    D --> E[Real-time dashboard update]
    
    F[Parent/student views grade] --> G[Tiger Grades web interface]
    G --> H[Database query]
    H --> I[Display updated grade]
```

### Conflict Resolution

The system handles simultaneous edits through:
- **Timestamp-based precedence** for concurrent updates
- **Teacher override capability** for final grade authority
- **Audit logging** for all grade changes
- **Rollback functionality** for error correction

## üé® Customization Options

### Grading Scales

Support for multiple grading scales:

```php
$gradingScales = [
    'percentage' => ['min' => 0, 'max' => 100, 'passing' => 70],
    'letter' => ['A' => 90, 'B' => 80, 'C' => 70, 'D' => 60, 'F' => 0],
    'ib' => ['min' => 1, 'max' => 7, 'passing' => 4],
    'cambridge' => ['A*' => 90, 'A' => 80, 'B' => 70, 'C' => 60]
];
```

### Color Coding

Automatic color coding for quick visual assessment:
- üü¢ **Green** (90-100%): Excellent performance
- üü° **Yellow** (70-89%): Good performance  
- üü† **Orange** (60-69%): Needs improvement
